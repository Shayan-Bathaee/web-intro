This repository contains a collection of mini projects from an introductory programming class taken at UCSC. The purpose of these projects was to get an elementary grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The home page has a small description about me and the class, along with links to every lab. Feel free to explore my first attempt at developing websites!
